Exercise 1:
  Q1:
    CvMat is a matrix which reperesents the pixel values of the image. It is accessed by rows, not columns. (i,j) if it was (2,1) then it would be row 2 column 1.
    

Exercise 2:
  Q1: In each of the 3 colors, RGB, the range of pixel values is 0-255. 
  

Exercise 4:
  Q1: Binary thresholding causes the image to lose brightness and detail. This is due to the fact that binary thresholding only keeps pixel values which are higher than the threshold
  
  Q2: Adapative thresholding allows us to have multiple thresholds therefore different thresholds can be set for different regions
